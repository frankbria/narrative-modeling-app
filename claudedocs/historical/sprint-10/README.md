- **Testing**: Comprehensive integration test suite with Docker Compose infrastructure
- **Operations**: Production-ready monitoring runbook with incident procedures

### Sprint Velocity
- **Planned**: 27 story points
- **Completed**: 27 story points (100%)
- **Duration**: 3 days (accelerated sprint)
- **Risk Level**: Low (non-breaking improvements)

## Follow-up Sprints

**Sprint 11**: Data Model & Performance (Oct 10-14, 2025)
- Focus: Refactor data models, implement transformation validation, performance benchmarks
- Points: 29 story points
- Risk: High (data model refactoring with database migration)
