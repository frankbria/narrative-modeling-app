- ✅ Video recording on failure
- ✅ Trace collection on retry
- ✅ Automatic dev server startup

**Test Scripts Added**:
```json
{
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",

## Technical Decisions

### Fixture Design
- **Decision**: Merged fixtures in index.ts rather than separate test extends
- **Rationale**: Simpler import pattern, single test object for all tests
- **Implementation**: Combined AuthFixtures & DataFixtures with type merging

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: Support SKIP_AUTH mode for development and CI
- **Rationale**: Allows testing without full auth infrastructure
- **Implementation**: Environment variable check with fallback to full auth flow

### Page Objects
- **Decision**: Base page pattern with inheritance
- **Rationale**: Consistent interface, shared utilities, easy extension
- **Implementation**: BasePage with common methods, specialized pages extend

### Test Data
- **Decision**: Fallback CSV generation if test-data file missing
- **Rationale**: Resilient tests that don't fail on missing files
- **Implementation**: Try/catch with default CSV buffer creation

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Browser Installation
- **Issue**: Playwright browsers require manual installation
- **Impact**: Tests cannot run without `npx playwright install`
- **Resolution**: Documented in README, included in CI/CD workflow

### Authentication Testing
- **Issue**: Auth fixtures assume specific UI selectors
- **Impact**: May need adjustment based on actual auth implementation
- **Resolution**: Documented selector assumptions, easy to update

### Dataset Cleanup
- **Issue**: Cleanup depends on API endpoint existence
- **Impact**: Tests may leave data if cleanup fails
- **Resolution**: Error handling with warnings, documented limitation
