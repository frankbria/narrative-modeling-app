## Stories

### Story 10.1: Prometheus Metrics Integration (Priority: 🟡, Points: 8)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Started**: 2025-10-09
**Completed**: 2025-10-09

**As a** SRE
**I want** Prometheus metrics for system and ML operations
**So that** I can monitor performance and identify issues proactively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] System metrics exposed: request latency, error rates, throughput
- [x] ML metrics exposed: training duration, prediction latency, model accuracy
- [x] Business metrics exposed: active users, datasets created, models trained
- [x] Metrics endpoint `/metrics` accessible
- [x] Metrics follow Prometheus naming conventions

**Technical Tasks:**
1. Install and configure Prometheus client - 1.5h
   - Files: `apps/backend/requirements.txt`, `apps/backend/app/middleware/metrics.py` (new)
   - Add prometheus-client library: `prometheus-client==0.19.0`
   - Create metrics registry
   - Configure metrics HTTP handler at `/metrics`

2. Implement request metrics middleware - 2h
   - File: `apps/backend/app/middleware/metrics.py:20-80`
   - Track request latency histogram (buckets: 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10s)
   - Track request count by endpoint and status code
   - Track active request gauge
   - Add labels: endpoint, method, status_code

3. Implement ML operation metrics - 2.5h
   - File: `apps/backend/app/services/metrics_collector.py` (new)
   - Track training duration histogram
   - Track prediction latency histogram
   - Track model accuracy gauge (updated after training)
   - Track dataset size histogram
   - Add labels: model_type, problem_type, dataset_id

4. Implement business metrics - 2h
   - File: `apps/backend/app/services/metrics_collector.py:100-150`
   - Track active users gauge (from auth)
   - Track datasets created counter
   - Track models trained counter
   - Track predictions made counter
   - Add time-based labels (day, week, month)

**Dependencies:**
- Sprint 8: API versioning (metrics paths)

**Risks:**
- Metrics overhead may impact performance
- High cardinality labels could cause issues

**Progress:**
- ✅ Installed prometheus-client library (v0.23.1)

  - Request latency histogram (buckets: 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10s)
  - Request count by endpoint, method, and status code
  - Active requests gauge
- ✅ Created ML and business metrics collector in `app/services/metrics_collector.py`
  - ML metrics: training duration, prediction latency, model accuracy, dataset size
  - Business metrics: active users, datasets created, models trained, predictions made
- ✅ Registered metrics middleware and `/metrics` endpoint in `app/main.py`
- ✅ Created comprehensive tests with 100% coverage (35 tests)
  - `tests/test_middleware/test_metrics.py` (16 tests)
  - `tests/test_services/test_metrics_collector.py` (19 tests)
