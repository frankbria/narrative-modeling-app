## Performance Analysis

### Bottleneck Identification

**Fast Operations** (<100ms):
- All transformation previews
- Single predictions
- Logistic Regression training (small datasets)

**Medium Operations** (100ms-1s):
- Transformation application for 100K rows
- Logistic Regression training (50K rows)
- Batch predictions (1K-10K rows)

**Slower Operations** (1-10s):
- Random Forest training (50K rows with 100 trees)
- XGBoost training (50K rows)
- Very large batch predictions (>100K rows)

**Optimization Opportunities**:
1. ✅ Already optimized: n_jobs=-1 for parallelization
2. ✅ Efficient algorithms: Using hist tree method for XGBoost
3. 📌 Future: Consider GPU acceleration for large-scale training
4. 📌 Future: Implement prediction batching with optimal batch sizes

### Memory Profiling

Memory efficiency tests included for:
- Batch predictions (1K and 10K rows)
- Shows memory overhead per prediction
- Helps identify memory leaks or inefficiencies

**Note**: Full memory profiling results available when running:
```bash
pytest tests/benchmarks/test_prediction_perf.py::TestPredictionMemoryEfficiency -v
```

## Scalability Characteristics

### Transformation Scalability
- **Linear scaling**: Transformation time scales linearly with data size
- **Efficient implementation**: Pandas operations well-optimized
- **Preview optimization**: Preview only processes requested rows (n_rows=100)

### Training Scalability
- **Sub-linear for simple models**: Logistic Regression scales efficiently
- **Near-linear for tree models**: RF and XGBoost scale predictably
- **Memory efficient**: Can handle 50K+ rows in memory

### Prediction Scalability
- **Constant time per row**: Single prediction latency consistent
- **Batch efficiency**: Larger batches amortize overhead
- **Throughput scaling**: Batch predictions scale well with size

## Recommendations

### Performance Optimization Priorities

**Low Priority** (already meeting targets by large margins):
1. Transformation operations
2. Model training for small-medium datasets
3. Single predictions

**Monitor** (good performance, watch for regression):
1. Batch prediction throughput for very large batches
2. Memory usage during concurrent operations
3. Training time for very complex models (deep trees, many estimators)

**Future Enhancements**:
1. **GPU Acceleration**: For large-scale model training (>100K rows)
2. **Distributed Processing**: For transformation of datasets >1M rows
3. **Model Caching**: Reduce repeated training overhead
4. **Prediction Batching**: Optimize batch sizes for throughput

### Monitoring Strategy

**Critical Metrics** (alert if degraded):
- Transformation application time (100K rows): >1s
- Model training time (50K rows): >60s
- Single prediction latency: >50ms

**Performance Regression Testing**:
- Run benchmark suite weekly
- Compare against baseline (this report)
- Alert on >20% degradation in any metric
