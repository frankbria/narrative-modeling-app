## Sprint 7: Production Readiness - Authentication & Health (Week 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE

> **⚠️ CORRECTION NOTE (2025-10-08)**: This sprint is now COMPLETE. Stories 7.3-7.5 (17 points) were deprecated as they referenced non-existent test files. The core objectives (JWT auth and health checks) were successfully achieved. See SPRINT_7_COMPLETION.md for full details.

### Sprint Goal
Eliminate critical production blockers by implementing real authentication and comprehensive health checks for production readiness.

### Capacity Planning
- **Team Size**: 1 developer
- **Velocity Target**: 30 story points
- **Focus**: Security & Reliability
- **Risk Level**: Medium (security-critical changes)

### User Stories

#### ✅ Story 7.1: Real JWT Authentication (Priority: 🔴, Points: 8) - COMPLETE

**STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETE (Pre-existing implementation validated)
**Completed**: 2025-10-07
**Implementation Time**: 0h (already implemented in prior sprints)

**As a** system administrator
**I want** secure JWT validation for NextAuth v5 tokens
**So that** only authenticated users can access protected endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Given a valid NextAuth v5 JWT token, when the token is validated, then authentication succeeds with user identity
- [x] Given an expired token, when validation is attempted, then returns 401 Unauthorized
- [x] Given an invalid signature, when validation is attempted, then returns 401 Unauthorized
- [x] Given missing required claims, when validation is attempted, then returns 401 Unauthorized
- [x] All authentication flows are covered by unit tests with >95% coverage

**Technical Tasks:**
1. Implement JWT signature verification - 3h
   - File: `apps/backend/app/auth/nextauth_auth.py:15-50`
   - Implementation: Use PyJWT library to validate NextAuth v5 token signature with NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   - Add token expiration checking (exp claim)
   - Validate required claims: sub (user ID), email, iat (issued at)

2. Add token claim extraction - 2h
   - File: `apps/backend/app/auth/nextauth_auth.py:52-80`
   - Extract user identity from token claims (sub, email, name)
   - Handle optional claims gracefully
   - Return structured User model

3. Error handling for auth failures - 1h
   - File: `apps/backend/app/auth/nextauth_auth.py:82-100`
   - Implement specific exceptions: TokenExpiredError, InvalidTokenError, InvalidClaimsError
   - Return appropriate HTTP 401 responses with error details

4. Unit tests for all auth scenarios - 2h
   - File: `apps/backend/tests/test_auth/test_nextauth_jwt.py` (new)
   - Test valid token → successful authentication
   - Test expired token → 401 Unauthorized
   - Test invalid signature → 401 Unauthorized
   - Test missing claims → 401 Unauthorized
   - Mock NextAuth v5 token generation for tests

**Dependencies:** None (can start immediately)

**Risks:**
- NextAuth v5 token format changes require frontend coordination
- Secret key management in production environment

**Implementation Notes:**
- JWT authentication was already fully implemented in `apps/backend/app/auth/nextauth_auth.py`
- Uses python-jose library with HS256 algorithm
- Proper error handling for expired tokens, invalid signatures, missing claims
- Development bypass mode with SKIP_AUTH environment variable
- Test coverage exists in `tests/test_auth/test_nextauth.py`

**As a** system reliability engineer
**I want** circuit breakers on all external service calls
**So that** failures cascade gracefully and systems can recover automatically

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Given S3 is down, when circuit opens, then fallback to error response without retry storms
- [x] Given OpenAI API fails 5 times, when circuit breaker triggers, then fail fast for 60s
- [x] Given MongoDB recovers, when circuit closes, then normal operations resume
- [x] Circuit breaker metrics are exposed for monitoring
- [x] Exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd

**Technical Tasks:**

3. Implement OpenAI circuit breaker - 3h
   - File: `apps/backend/app/services/openai_service.py:20-150`
   - Wrap all OpenAI calls (analyze_data, generate_insights) with circuit breaker
   - Configure: max_attempts=3 (faster fail for expensive API), circuit_open_duration=60s
   - Add fallback: return generic insights or queue for retry
   - Handle rate limiting with separate retry logic

4. Implement MongoDB circuit breaker - 3h
   - File: `apps/backend/app/storage/mongodb_storage.py:30-200`
   - Wrap database operations (find, insert, update, delete) with circuit breaker
   - Configure: max_attempts=5, exponential backoff
   - Add fallback: return stale cache or error with retry guidance
   - Implement connection pooling health checks
