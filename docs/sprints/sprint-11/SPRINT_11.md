## 🔎 Conflicting Implementation Plans Analysis

**Document Comparison**: SPRINT_11.md vs SPRINT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### ✅ **No Major Conflicts Detected**

**Alignment Status:**
- ✅ Sprint goals are identical between both documents
- ✅ Story priorities and points match across documents  
- ✅ Technical tasks align with actual implementation
- ✅ Acceptance criteria consistent in both plans

**Minor Differences Noted:**
1. **Story 11.5 (Migration Testing)**:
   - SPRINT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md: Planned with database migration scripts
   - SPRINT_11.md: Deferred due to separate collection architecture
   - **Resolution**: Architecture decision to use separate collections eliminates migration need

2. **Implementation Approach**:
   - SPRINT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md: Assumes UserData model replacement
   - SPRINT_11.md: Documents parallel model approach with backward compatibility
   - **Resolution**: Parallel approach reduces risk while maintaining functionality

**Recommendation**: Both documents are consistent with implementation reality. SPRINT_11.md reflects the executed approach with architectural improvements.
